Hi there! I’m **Paula**, a passionate tech enthusiast currently studying **Computer Science** at Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, as part of the Erasmus programme. 
I’m particularly interested in information security, with a focus on both technical systems and the human aspects of security, including how user behavior, usability, and awareness influence overall security.

Alongside my studies, I've had the opportunity to:
- Work as a **Specialist COE** in the Large Companies Office, managing critical banking operations, international transfers, and direct communication with clients.  
- Provide **technical support** and review hardware/software for professors at the **Centro de Formación Permanente**, ensuring smooth operation of IT systems.
